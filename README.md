## Sun Shafts (Modified for PPSv2)

This is Unity's legacy Sun Shaft post processing effect, modified to work with the Post Processing Stack v2 (PPSv2). Tested using the Standard Rendering Pipeline.

### IMPORTING/INSTALLING:

Simply add the entire folder into your Assets folder.

### USAGE:

Add the SunShafts script/component to the Main Camera. Set the shader properties to the shaders included. Check the example scene to learn more. Note: The effect isn't visible in the Editor. Enter Play mode or build the project in order for it to render.
